# CodeAlpha_Data-Visualization

In this task, I worked on visualizing a dataset of motivational quotes using Python.  
The objective was to analyze the data and generate some useful graphs that show interesting insights.  

Steps:  
- Imported the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).  
- Loaded the dataset (quotes.csv) into a pandas DataFrame.  
- Extracted the top 5 authors with the most quotes.  
- Plotted a bar chart showing the number of quotes by each of these authors.  
- Calculated the length of each quote and added it as a new column.  
- Plotted a histogram to show the distribution of quote lengths.  

 Dataset:  
- The dataset contains two columns: *Quote* and *Author*.  
- File used: quotes.csv  

 Output:  
- Bar chart of *Top 5 Authors with Most Quotes*.  
- Histogram showing *Quote Length Distribution*.
